Machine Learning Final Project for MSDS 601: Linear Regression Analysis of Health Insurance Costs

My name is Dashiell Brookhart and Christabelle Pabalan, Sicheng Zhou, and I created this project for our Linear Regression Analysis class as part of the University of San Francisco's Masters in Data Science program.

This project is in regard to 5 main research questions:

   1. What are the differences in significant predictors of health insurance cost for individuals who smoke and those who do not?
    
   2. For a 45 year old individual with a BMI of 35 in the subset population of smokers, what is the expected cost of their health insurance?
    
   3. For a 45 year old individual living in the northwest with 3 children in the subset population of nonsmokers, what is the expected cost of their health insurance?
    
   4. How does the cost of health insurance change for an individual in the nonsmoker population when they have a child?
    
   5. How does health insurance price change in respect to an increase in body mass index within the smoker population?

For a detailed analysis to these questions please refer to the Final_report.pdf.
